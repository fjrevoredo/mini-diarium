# Code of Conduct

## Our Standards

Mini Diarium is a small open-source project. We want participation to be a positive experience for everyone. We ask that all contributors and community members:

- Be respectful and constructive in discussions
- Accept feedback graciously and give it kindly
- Focus on what's best for the project and its users
- Show empathy toward other community members

Unacceptable behavior includes harassment, trolling, personal attacks, and publishing others' private information.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all project spaces: issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other communication channels associated with the project.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior can be reported to the project maintainer. All reports will be reviewed and addressed appropriately. The maintainer reserves the right to remove, edit, or reject contributions that violate this code of conduct, and to temporarily or permanently ban contributors for repeated or severe violations.
